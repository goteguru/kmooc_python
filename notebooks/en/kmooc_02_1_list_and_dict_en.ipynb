        "Beyond simple numeric and textual data, Python has many composite data structures, especially when you include those available via importable packages. It's important to know the built-in structures because you encounter them everywhere. These are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- list : list of values\n",
        "- set : set\n",
        "- dict : dictionary (key-value pairs)\n",
        "- tuple : fixed-length value list (not extendable)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can create any of them by name (empty or by providing parameters for their values) and each has some special notation as well. (see below)\n",
        "\n",
        "All of these structures are iterable, which means you can step through their elements or, if you like, take values out of them one by one. This is important because many Python constructs work with iterable objects. As we'll see, loops and generator constructs work this way.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Since these structures all store multiple values (just in slightly different ways) they can be converted into each other."
